 *     as a json file, so that it keeps the current state of the HashTable and avoid loss of work
 * 
 * This endpoint was necessitated for a few reasons
 *        - on glitch.com where the backend app was hosted, glitch puts all applicatiosn to sleep once 
 *          they are inactive after like 1 hours. This is part of their policy to ensure that made projects
 *          launched on thier platform fast and available to everyone without hitches. But when there is a 
 *          request for the project eitehr by someone accessing the site/domain, then it comes back to live
 *        - as a result, and because our backend is not using persistent database like mysql, mssql, sqlite etc 
 *          but an in-memory hash table, everytime it got accessed and brought alive from sleep, everything 
 *          starts afresh. We would have lost all data prior to the backend app going to sleep.
 *        - this made us consider the possibility of dumping the hash table into a json file as a way to preserve
 *          the data.
 *    This had to be done by any of us by just calling this endpoint on browser.
